# DevOps Learning BASH

## Overview

This repository contains a series of bash scripts to practice key shell scripting concepts and enhance my Linux command-line skills. Each script targets a specific task or concept commonly used in bash scripting.

## Purpose 

To document and showcase the bash scripting practice exercises I have completed to strengthen my command-line and automation abilities.


## Scripts Overview

Task 1 - Basic Arithmetic
A script that accepts two numbers as input and performs addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division (with division by zero check), outputting the results.

Task 2 - File Operations
Creates a directory, navigates into it, creates a file inside it, writes text to the file, then displays the file’s contents.

Task 3 - Conditional Statements
Checks if a file exists and reports its status (exists or not), and if present, reports whether it’s readable, writable, or executable.

Task 4 - Backup Script
Copies all  .txt  files from a specified directory to a backup directory, creating the backup directory if it does not exist.

Extra Task - String Manipulation and File Read
A script that demonstrates string operations (e.g., extracting substrings) and reading content from a file to display or process it.


## What I Learned

Through solving these challenges, I have gained practical experience in:  

- Reading user inputs and performing arithmetic operations in bash.
- Basic file and directory manipulation.
- Using conditional checks to verify file existence and permissions.
- Implementing simple backup automation.


## How to Use This Repo

- Browse the script files directly on GitHub to study the code.
- Clone the repo if you want to run or modify the scripts locally: https://github.com/muntas1rr/DevOps-Learning-BASH.git 
- Run the scripts in a bash-enabled terminal environment for hands-on practice.


## Next Steps

- Continue practicing more complex bash scripting scenarios.
- Explore shell scripting best practices and automation workflows.
